## Project Overview
This project is an iOS application that showcases various advanced iOS development techniques and best practices, including MVVM architecture, dependency injection, and more. The app includes functionalities such as playing music, a custom network debouncer, and programmatic layout of UI components.

## Features
- **MVVM Architecture**: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel pattern for better separation of concerns and easier testing.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses dependency injection to manage dependencies and improve testability.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests for various components of the application.
- **Generic and Reusable Network Layer**: Implements a generic and reusable network layer to handle API requests.
- **No Third-Party Libraries**: The project does not rely on any third-party libraries.
- **Play Music with AVPlayer**: Uses AVPlayer to play music.
- **Custom Network Debouncer**: Reduces the number of API calls using a custom network debouncer.
- **Programmatic Layout**: All UI components are laid out programmatically without the use of Storyboards or XIBs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture**: The project is structured using the MVVM pattern, ensuring a clear separation between UI, business logic, and data manipulation. This pattern enhances testability and maintainability.
  
- **Dependency Injection**: The project employs dependency injection to provide necessary dependencies to various components, enhancing modularity and facilitating unit testing.

- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests have been written for the view models and network layer to ensure robustness and correctness of the application logic.

- **Generic and Reusable Network Layer**: A flexible and reusable network layer is implemented to handle API interactions, making it easy to extend and maintain.

- **AVPlayer for Audio Playback**: The application uses AVPlayer for seamless audio playback, demonstrating skills in handling media playback in iOS.

- **Custom Network Debouncer**: A custom debouncing mechanism is implemented to optimize network requests, reducing unnecessary API calls and improving performance.

- **Programmatic Layout**: The entire UI layout is done programmatically, showcasing proficiency in creating and managing views without using Interface Builder or Storyboards.

## AI Tools Utilized
This project benefited from the use of AI tools like ChatGPT for various tasks:
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved code readability and maintainability.
- **Organizing Business Logic**: Assisted in structuring business logic more effectively.
- **Idea Generation**: Provided useful suggestions for structuring and enhancing the project.
- **Debugging UI Problems**: Helped troubleshoot and resolve UI issues.
- **README Production**: Generated an initial README template that was further customized.

## Dependencies
- **No third-party libraries used**. The project relies solely on the native iOS frameworks.
